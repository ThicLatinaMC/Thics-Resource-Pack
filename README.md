## Info
This pack is a pull together of all my favourite packs, and some of my own custom textures. This pack does require [Optifine](https://www.optifine.net/home) (or a workaround for [Optifine](https://www.optifine.net/home)), and I personally use it on an install of [Fabric 1.18.2](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/). As [Optifine](https://www.optifine.net/home) is only made for [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/), I get around this by using [Optifabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optifabric). But wherever [Optifine](https://www.optifine.net/home) is present, this pack should work.

It is also worth noting I use this pack along side Shaders, and it works BEAUTIFULLY! Never have any problems with it. 

## Installation
To install this pack, please check out the latest [releases](https://github.com/ThicLatinaMC/Thics-Resource-Pack/releases) page

1. Download the pack
2. Open the 'Resource Packs' folder
3. Drag the downloaded pack into the Resource Packs folder (dont worry about unzipping it).
4. It might say its made for an older version of minecraft, just ignore this
5. If you are using other packs, I suggest putting this one at the top!!

## Troubleshooting
If for whatever reason you are having trouble with the pack, these would be the first things that I check-

1. Check your minecraft version, try and make sure its at least 1.18.x
2. Check to make sure you have a 1.18.x version of [Optifine](https://www.optifine.net/home) installed (this must match your version of Minecraft you are playing). If you are having problems with [Optifine](https://www.optifine.net/home) installation you might find it easier just using a launcher ready made with [Optifine](https://www.optifine.net/home) like [Lunar](https://www.lunarclient.com/)
3. If you are not seeing the pack in your list of Resource Packs, i would suggest extracting/unzipping the pack and adding the folder itself into the pack
